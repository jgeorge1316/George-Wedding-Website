                <h2>My Findings</h2>
                <p>After analyzing my data,I've learned a lot about Bob Dylan and his career. I
                    analyzed data about instruments played,tracks,verses,genres and album types.Over
                    the year, he his top three most frequently used instruments were the same across
                    both periods.The most suprising thing I learned about his instrumentation was
                    that he does not use a harmonica in all of his albums.He also uses less
                    instruments in his late years. Dylan gets more experimental over the years and
                    explores more genres in the later part of his career. He created music that
                    explored 15 different genres that included jazz,R&amp;B,funk and many more.His
                    most frequent genres are also consistent among both periods. Over the years,he
                    is consistent in number of verses but has a increases his average song length
                    over time.However,he decreases his average track count per album. In terms of
                    album types,he releases more compilation and live albums. This explains why he
                    has a lower amount of original content produced.Lastly,he increases the amount
                    of format types he releases his albums on from 3 to 5. </p>
